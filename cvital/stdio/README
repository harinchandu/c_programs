ctl+d indicates EOF (-1).




Whenever you input a character or string from stdin in C, always make sure there is no \n in the input buffer. To do this, always getchar() after taking integer or float inputs.

In your case, maybe you've inputted an integer before inputting the character. So try to write a getchar() before taking the character input.
